# Export Meeting Tool

## Overview

The exportmeeting tool is a command-line application that extracts meeting attendance data from an SQLite database used
by the Quorum Calculator and writes it to a CSV file.

The tool supports exporting data for all meetings or for a specific committee.

## CSV Format

The generated CSV file is structured with:

- **First row**: The start date of each meeting in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

- **Subsequent rows**: Names of attendees, aligned under the meetings they attended. Each row represents the nth
  attendee across all meetings.

For example:

| 2023-01-01 | 2023-02-01 | 2023-03-01 |
|------------|------------|------------|
| alice      | bob        | alice      |
| bob        | charlie    | bob        |
|            |            | charlie    |

In this example:

- Three meetings are shown.

- Each cell contains the nickname of an attendee if they attended that meeting.

## Command-Line Usage

```sh
./bin/exportmeeting -committee="TC 1" -meeting="meetings.csv" -database="oqcd.sqlite"
```
